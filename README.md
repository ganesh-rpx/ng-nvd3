This is a nvd3 directive for AngularJS. It currently supports pie Chart, line Chart, scatter Chart and horizontal Bar Chart.

###Basic Setup
```
Note: This directive module is dependent on angular, d3 and nvd3
1. Install the directive using bower install ng-nvd3 --save
2. This would add install the dependencies required for this directive and the directive itself
3. Include the dependencies in the <head> tag of the html document. For example
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/nvd3/nv.d3.css"/>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.16/angular.min.js"></script>
