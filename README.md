##AngularJS directive for nvd3.js charts
This is a nvd3 directive for AngularJS. It currently supports pie chart, line chart, scatter chart and bar chart. This is a lightweight directive which has the ability to allow the output graph to be responsive.

###Basic Setup
```
Note: This directive module is dependent on angular, d3 and nvd3
1. Install the directive using bower install ng-nvd3 --save
2. This would add install the dependencies required for this directive and the directive itself
3. Include the dependencies in the <head> tag of the html document. For example
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/nvd3/nv.d3.css"/>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.16/angular.min.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="http://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js"></script>
  <script src="bower_components/nvd3/nv.d3.js"></script>
  <script src="bower_components/angularjs-nvd3-directives/dist/angularjs-nvd3-directives.js"></script>
  
  Note: I have added d3.v3.min.js as a direct link in the script tag above. You can either download the d3.v3.js from this repository provided in lib folder or use the direct link as shown above
```
