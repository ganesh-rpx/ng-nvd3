It currently supports pie chart, line chart, scatter chart, bar chart and line-plus-bar graph. This is a lightweight directive which has the ability to allow the output graph to be responsive.\r\n\r\n###Basic Setup\r\nUsing bower:\r\nbower install ng-nvd3 --save\r\n\r\n```\r\nNote: This directive module is dependent on angular, d3 and nvd3\r\n1. Install the directive using bower install ng-nvd3 --save\r\n2. This would add install the dependencies required for this directive and the directive itself\r\n3. Include the dependencies in the <head> tag of the html document. For example\r\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"bower_components/nvd3/nv.d3.css\"/>\r\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.16/angular.min.js\"></script>\r\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js\"></script>\r\n  <script src=\"bower_components/nvd3/nv.d3.js\"></script>\r\n  <script src=\"bower_components/angularjs-nvd3-directives/dist/angularjs-nvd3-directives.js\"></script>\r\n  \r\n  Note: I have added d3.v3.min.js as a direct link in the script tag above.
